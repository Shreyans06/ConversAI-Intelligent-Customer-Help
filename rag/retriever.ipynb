Most deep learning methods require substantial\\namounts of manually labeled data, which restricts their applicability in many domains that suffer\\nfrom a dearth of annotated resources [ 61]. In these situations, models that can leverage linguistic\\ninformation from unlabeled data provide a valuable alternative to gathering more annotation, which\\ncan be time-consuming and expensive. Further, even in cases where considerable supervision\\nis available, learning good representations in an unsupervised fashion can provide a signiﬁcant\\nperformance boost. The most compelling evidence for this so far has been the extensive use of pre-\\ntrained word embeddings [ 10,39,42] to improve performance on a range of NLP tasks [ 8,11,26,45].\\nLeveraging more than word-level information from unlabeled text, however, is challenging for two\\nmain reasons. First, it is unclear what type of optimization objectives are most effective at learning\\ntext representations that are useful for transfer. Recent research has looked at various objectives\\nsuch as language modeling [ 44], machine translation [ 38], and discourse coherence [ 22], with each\\nmethod outperforming the others on different tasks.1Second, there is no consensus on the most\\neffective way to transfer these learned representations to the target task. Existing techniques involve\\na combination of making task-speciﬁc changes to the model architecture [ 43,44], using intricate\\nlearning schemes [ 21] and adding auxiliary learning objectives [ 50]. These uncertainties have made\\nit difﬁcult to develop effective semi-supervised learning approaches for language processing.\\n1https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard\\nPreprint.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'language_understanding_paper.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='In this paper, we explore a semi-supervised approach for language understanding tasks using a\\ncombination of unsupervised pre-training and supervised ﬁne-tuning. Our goal is to learn a universal\\nrepresentation that transfers with little adaptation to a wide range of tasks. We assume access to\\na large corpus of unlabeled text and several datasets with manually annotated training examples\\n(target tasks). Our setup does not require these target tasks to be in the same domain as the unlabeled\\ncorpus. We employ a two-stage training procedure. First, we use a language modeling objective on\\nthe unlabeled data to learn the initial parameters of a neural network model. Subsequently, we adapt\\nthese parameters to a target task using the corresponding supervised objective.\\nFor our model architecture, we use the Transformer [62], which has been shown to perform strongly on\\nvarious tasks such as machine translation [ 62], document generation [ 34], and syntactic parsing [ 29].\\nThis model choice provides us with a more structured memory for handling long-term dependencies in\\ntext, compared to alternatives like recurrent networks, resulting in robust transfer performance across\\ndiverse tasks. During transfer, we utilize task-speciﬁc input adaptations derived from traversal-style\\napproaches [ 52], which process structured text input as a single contiguous sequence of tokens. As\\nwe demonstrate in our experiments, these adaptations enable us to ﬁne-tune effectively with minimal\\nchanges to the architecture of the pre-trained model.\\nWe evaluate our approach on four types of language understanding tasks – natural language inference,\\nquestion answering, semantic similarity, and text classiﬁcation. Our general task-agnostic model\\noutperforms discriminatively trained models that employ architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each\\ntask, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance,\\nwe achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test) [ 40],\\n5.7% on question answering (RACE) [ 30], 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI) [ 66] and 5.5% on\\nthe recently introduced GLUE multi-task benchmark [ 64]. We also analyzed zero-shot behaviors\\nof the pre-trained model on four different settings and demonstrate that it acquires useful linguistic\\nknowledge for downstream tasks.\\n2 Related Work\\nSemi-supervised learning for NLP Our work broadly falls under the category of semi-supervised\\nlearning for natural language. This paradigm has attracted signiﬁcant interest, with applications to\\ntasks like sequence labeling [ 24,33,57] or text classiﬁcation [ 41,70]. The earliest approaches used\\nunlabeled data to compute word-level or phrase-level statistics, which were then used as features in a\\nsupervised model [33]. Over the last few years, researchers have demonstrated the beneﬁts of using\\nword embeddings [ 11,39,42], which are trained on unlabeled corpora, to improve performance on a\\nvariety of tasks [ 8,11,26,45]. These approaches, however, mainly transfer word-level information,\\nwhereas we aim to capture higher-level semantics.\\nRecent approaches have investigated learning and utilizing more than word-level semantics from\\nunlabeled data. Phrase-level or sentence-level embeddings, which can be trained using an unlabeled\\ncorpus, have been used to encode text into suitable vector representations for various target tasks [ 28,\\n32, 1, 36, 22, 12, 56, 31].\\nUnsupervised pre-training Unsupervised pre-training is a special case of semi-supervised learning\\nwhere the goal is to ﬁnd a good initialization point instead of modifying the supervised learning\\nobjective. Early works explored the use of the technique in image classiﬁcation [ 20,49,63] and\\nregression tasks [ 3]. Subsequent research [ 15] demonstrated that pre-training acts as a regularization\\nscheme, enabling better generalization in deep neural networks. In recent work, the method has\\nbeen used to help train deep neural networks on various tasks like image classiﬁcation [ 69], speech\\nrecognition [68], entity disambiguation [17] and machine translation [48].\\nThe closest line of work to ours involves pre-training a neural network using a language modeling\\nobjective and then ﬁne-tuning it on a target task with supervision. Dai et al. [ 13] and Howard and\\nRuder [ 21] follow this method to improve text classiﬁcation. However, although the pre-training\\nphase helps capture some linguistic information, their usage of LSTM models restricts their prediction\\nability to a short range. In contrast, our choice of transformer networks allows us to capture longer-\\nrange linguistic structure, as demonstrated in our experiments. Further, we also demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our model on a wider range of tasks including natural language inference, paraphrase\\ndetection and story completion. Other approaches [ 43,44,38] use hidden representations from a\\n2'),\n",

This involves a substantial amount of new parameters for each separate\\ntarget task, whereas we require minimal changes to our model architecture during transfer.\\nAuxiliary training objectives Adding auxiliary unsupervised training objectives is an alternative\\nform of semi-supervised learning. Early work by Collobert and Weston [ 10] used a wide variety of\\nauxiliary NLP tasks such as POS tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and language modeling\\nto improve semantic role labeling. More recently, Rei [ 50] added an auxiliary language modeling\\nobjective to their target task objective and demonstrated performance gains on sequence labeling\\ntasks. Our experiments also use an auxiliary objective, but as we show, unsupervised pre-training\\nalready learns several linguistic aspects relevant to target tasks.\\n3 Framework\\nOur training procedure consists of two stages. The ﬁrst stage is learning a high-capacity language\\nmodel on a large corpus of text. This is followed by a ﬁne-tuning stage, where we adapt the model to\\na discriminative task with labeled data.\\n3.1 Unsupervised pre-training\\nGiven an unsupervised corpus of tokens U={u1,...,u n}, we use a standard language modeling\\nobjective to maximize the following likelihood:\\nL1(U) =∑\\nilogP(ui|ui−k,...,u i−1; Θ) (1)\\nwherekis the size of the context window, and the conditional probability Pis modeled using a neural\\nnetwork with parameters Θ. These parameters are trained using stochastic gradient descent [51].\\nIn our experiments, we use a multi-layer Transformer decoder [34] for the language model, which is\\na variant of the transformer [ 62]. This model applies a multi-headed self-attention operation over the\\ninput context tokens followed by position-wise feedforward layers to produce an output distribution\\nover target tokens:\\nh0=UWe+Wp\\nhl=transformer_block (hl−1)∀i∈[1,n]\\nP(u) =softmax (hnWT\\ne)(2)\\nwhereU= (u−k,...,u −1)is the context vector of tokens, nis the number of layers, Weis the token\\nembedding matrix, and Wpis the position embedding matrix.\\n3.2 Supervised ﬁne-tuning\\nAfter training the model with the objective in Eq. 1, we adapt the parameters to the supervised target\\ntask. We assume a labeled dataset C, where each instance consists of a sequence of input tokens,\\nx1,...,xm, along with a label y. The inputs are passed through our pre-trained model to obtain\\nthe ﬁnal transformer block’s activation hm\\nl, which is then fed into an added linear output layer with\\nparametersWyto predicty:\\nP(y|x1,...,xm) =softmax (hm\\nlWy). (3)\\nThis gives us the following objective to maximize:\\nL2(C) =∑\\n(x,y)logP(y|x1,...,xm). (4)\\nWe additionally found that including language modeling as an auxiliary objective to the ﬁne-tuning\\nhelped learning by (a) improving generalization of the supervised model, and (b) accelerating\\nconvergence. This is in line with prior work [ 50,43], who also observed improved performance with\\nsuch an auxiliary objective. Speciﬁcally, we optimize the following objective (with weight λ):\\nL3(C) =L2(C) +λ∗L1(C) (5)\\nOverall, the only extra parameters we require during ﬁne-tuning are Wy, and embeddings for delimiter\\ntokens (described below in Section 3.3).\\n3'),\n",

Since our pre-trained model\\nwas trained on contiguous sequences of text, we require some modiﬁcations to apply it to these tasks.\\nPrevious work proposed learning task speciﬁc architectures on top of transferred representations [ 44].\\nSuch an approach re-introduces a signiﬁcant amount of task-speciﬁc customization and does not\\nuse transfer learning for these additional architectural components. Instead, we use a traversal-style\\napproach [ 52], where we convert structured inputs into an ordered sequence that our pre-trained\\nmodel can process. These input transformations allow us to avoid making extensive changes to the\\narchitecture across tasks. We provide a brief description of these input transformations below and\\nFigure 1 provides a visual illustration. All transformations include adding randomly initialized start\\nand end tokens (⟨s⟩,⟨e⟩).\\nTextual entailment For entailment tasks, we concatenate the premise pand hypothesis htoken\\nsequences, with a delimiter token ( $) in between.\\nSimilarity For similarity tasks, there is no inherent ordering of the two sentences being compared.\\nTo reﬂect this, we modify the input sequence to contain both possible sentence orderings (with a\\ndelimiter in between) and process each independently to produce two sequence representations hm\\nl\\nwhich are added element-wise before being fed into the linear output layer.\\nQuestion Answering and Commonsense Reasoning For these tasks, we are given a context\\ndocumentz, a questionq, and a set of possible answers {ak}.

Although there has been a lot of\\nrecent interest [ 58,35,44], the task remains challenging due to the presence of a wide variety of\\nphenomena like lexical entailment, coreference, and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. We evaluate\\non ﬁve datasets with diverse sources, including image captions (SNLI), transcribed speech, popular\\nﬁction, and government reports (MNLI), Wikipedia articles (QNLI), science exams (SciTail) or news\\narticles (RTE).\\nTable 2 details various results on the different NLI tasks for our model and previous state-of-the-art\\napproaches.

By pre-training\\non a diverse corpus with long stretches of contiguous text our model acquires signiﬁcant world\\nknowledge and ability to process long-range dependencies which are then successfully transferred to\\nsolving discriminative tasks such as question answering, semantic similarity assessment, entailment\\ndetermination, and text classiﬁcation, improving the state of the art on 9 of the 12 datasets we\\nstudy. Using unsupervised (pre-)training to boost performance on discriminative tasks has long\\nbeen an important goal of Machine Learning research. Our work suggests that achieving signiﬁcant\\nperformance gains is indeed possible, and offers hints as to what models (Transformers) and data sets\\n(text with long range dependencies) work best with this approach. We hope that this will help enable\\nnew research into unsupervised learning, for both natural language understanding and other domains,\\nfurther improving our understanding of how and when unsupervised learning works.\\nReferences\\n[1] S.
